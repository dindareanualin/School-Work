Code I wrote for while in school, on various courses.

The "homework" part of the course which meant part of the final grade were these assignments.
A series of simple problems to solve. Done in C++.
Several items seem to be missing but they were missing from the homework requirement :) Just kept the indices to make sure there's no misunderstanding.
