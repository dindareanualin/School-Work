1. Solving the 2nd degree polynomial.
> tema1.cpp

2. Read a positive integer n. Display how many odd and how many even 
digits n is made out of, using a function for odd digits and a 
separate function for even digits.
> tema2.cpp

3. Check a number if it's "perfect" or not.
A "perfect" number is a number which is equal to the sum of its divisors, exculding itself
Example of perfect number: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
> tema3.cpp

4. Look for an int inside an array of ints and display the position at which
the int was found (if indeed it was found).
Start the numbering with 1 not zero as the beginning position in the array.
> tema4.cpp

7. Solve a 2 equations with 2 unknows system
a1 * x + b1 * y = c1
a2 * x + b2 * y = c2
Input: a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2.
Solve for x and y.
This implementation uses Cramer's rule to solve the system.
> tema7.cpp

8. Read the lenght and width of a rectangle.
Create an algorithm which will compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle,
using separate functions for the area and perimeter computation.
> tema8.cpp

9. Input an n lines, m columns matrix of positive integers.
Write an algorith which computes how many prime numbers are contained
within the matrix, using a function that determines if a number is prime or not.
> tema9.cpp

10. Given an n lines, m columns matrix, write an algorithm which will
 first display the matrix with each line sorted in ascending order,
then display the matrix with each column sorted in ascending order.
